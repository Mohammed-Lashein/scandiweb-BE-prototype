### 7 Habits of highly effective people
**Habit number 2:** Begin with the end in mind . 

So no need to finish the project to read the epilogue, I hope that you come here everyday to remember and see where you are going and what you are aiming for . 

If you finally finish this project (BE specifically) :
1. You will have gained a great experience in understanding Laravel (it was our guide for building this framework)
2. You will have built a framework of your own !
3. You will have learnt how some laravel internals work 
4. You will have gained a good experience by learning and implementing Design patterns 

Finally remember 
> On lifting others, we rise . 

So always help people and try to explain complex things in a beginner friendly way, because **every master was once a beginner** .
