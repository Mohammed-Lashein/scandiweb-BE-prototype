### Come here whenever you feel stuck or get bored of the project . 

It's okay to take some time off . 
It's okay to feel overwhelmed by the amount of new knowledge you need to know . 

But the most important thing : Keep doing it . 

Remember this quote :
> It gets easier. Every day it gets a little easier. But you gotta do it every day, that's the hard part. **But it does get easier**
