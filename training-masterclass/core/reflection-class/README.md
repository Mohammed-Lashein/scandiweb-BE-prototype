In this dir, I document my code along with the comments I wrote on learning about the Reflection API from popps book . 

I recommend using xdebug on trying to understand the code from ReflectionClassBookExample.php file because it has a lot of abstractions that are hard to understand without debugging . 

Also, creating a DI (Dependency injection) using this approach is beneficial, however it is hard to understand from the first time and also we won't be using it in our main task . 

So if this feels overwhelming to you (as it is to me), you can understand the core concept and then depend on laravel dealing with these abstractions for you so you can focus more on projects' business logic .
