# FE notes

1. We should follow the convention provided in scandipwa where they follow the vue principle of **SFC (Single File Components)** , but they are making it as Single **Folder** Components .
2. They are also using redux that's why he used it, even though using 
context was enough for a small project like this . 
1. In PWA docs, they mentioned that they are using BEM (which I happened to use also !) but they are using rebem-react package, which helps them provide more structure . 

If you use that package within your FE code, then it will be GREAT !!

5. Also, they added the support to tsx recently, if you had time return to studying ts to add support to the types (it won't be hard since most of the data are static and their structure is known )
6. Alaa eldyn added his reusable components to the ui folder (this is what shadcn also does -- I saw it in create a google drive clone by jsm when he created the otp modal)
