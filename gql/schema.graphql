  Here we can write our comments . 

  Why above we didn't prefix the param with $ ?
  => Good insight . 

  If the var is in the type definition of the schema, we don't prefix it with $ , while
  if the var is being referred to in a  mutation  expecting a var, then we will prefix it with $ . 

  Eg : 
  mutation deleteClient($id: ID) {
    deleteClient(id: $id) {
      id 
      name
      phone 
      email
    }
  }
